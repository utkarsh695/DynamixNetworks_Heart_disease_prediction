📌 Heart Disease Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project uses Machine Learning & Data Analytics to predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on clinical features.
It includes Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Training, Evaluation, and a Streamlit Web App for real-time predictions.

🚀 Project Overview

Heart disease is a leading cause of death globally. Early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes.
This project analyzes patient health data to build a model that predicts heart disease using key features such as:

Age

Gender

Chest pain type

Blood pressure

Cholesterol level

Maximum heart rate

Exercise-induced angina

And more…
